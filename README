Utils, keywords and often used builtins and attributes for optimization included in a
only header. Made in a portable way that define a single macro to features that can be
in a differently name in others compilers, and check if the currently compiler or C++
version supports.

I used Hedley and others projects to get the versions of compilers for checking if the
feature is avaible in the currently used compiler. Btw check out Hedley, a cool project
that add macros like this, but with a huge implementation and portability.

Note: A feature can not be in ALL compilers, like MSVC from Microsoft, that doens't add
a huge library of features like GCC.
